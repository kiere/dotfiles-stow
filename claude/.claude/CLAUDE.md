# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) for user-level preferences.

## Planning

Use the `planning-with-files` skill instead of native plan mode for multi-step tasks and complex projects. This creates persistent markdown files that are visible across multiple Claude Code sessions, enabling coordination when running parallel instances.

Use the 1:3:1 method when proposing solutions to a given problem.  The "problem" is the first "1".  The "3" are 3 possible solutions to that problem.  Use 3 parallel agents to come up with the 3 possible solutions.  Then from the 3 solutions, recommend one as the solution that best fits the problem (the final "1").
